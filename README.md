Detailed Log of Skating Progression

Hello! My name is Andrew Giovengo. I am a competitive figure skater. When I started figure skating, I started tracking all of my hours on the ice and used that information to form this repository.
This repository includes all of my data, as well as some information in the excel spreadsheet as to how I'm processing some of the data.
I also include charts to visualize progressions.
